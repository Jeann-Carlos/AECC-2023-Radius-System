# AECC-2023-Radius-System

This repository contains a private radius network system that will be connected to Flask for the "AECC" (Asociaci√≥n Estudiantil de Ciencias de Computos).

## Description

The AECC-2023-Radius-System is a private network system designed to provide secure authentication, authorization, and accounting services for network access. It utilizes the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol, which allows centralized management of user access to network resources.

The system will be integrated with Flask, a Python web framework, to provide a user-friendly interface for managing the RADIUS server, configuring network policies, and monitoring user activity.

## Features

- Secure authentication: The system ensures that only authorized users can access the network resources by validating their credentials.
- Authorization management: It allows administrators to define and enforce access policies based on user roles and permissions.
- Accounting and logging: The system tracks and logs network usage, providing valuable insights into user activity and resource consumption.
- Integration with Flask: The Flask framework provides an intuitive and customizable interface for managing the RADIUS system and its configurations.
